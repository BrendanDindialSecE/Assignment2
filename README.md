# Assignment 2: Discount Digital Games (DDG) Store

**ALL GAMES ON SALE!**

Welcome to Discount Digital Games (DDG)! This is a retro-vibe gaming discount shop styled with a sleek purple/blue dark theme. The site is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of animation to enhance the user's experience. It’s fully responsive across all devices from desktops to mobile phones.

## Design Choices

- **Color Scheme**:  
  I chose a dark purple/blue theme with neon blue and purple highlights for buttons, titles and hover effects. This gives the website a nostalgic retro-tech feel.
  
- **Font**:  
  The site uses the **Rajdhani** font for a clean modern look. It’s bold but not overwhelming making it perfect for a digital store.

- **Header and Navigation**:  
  The header features a title with a tagline and a logo aligned on the left side. Navigation is simple ensuring easy access to different pages. Hover effects turn links into a brighter blue with purple box shadows to enhance immersion.

- **Main Content**:  
  Sale sections use large eye-catching fonts and contrasting colors to draw attention to current offers. Game discount cards have glowing hover effects adding subtle interactivity and making promotions stand out.

- **Animations**:  
  Titles and taglines slide in smoothly when the page loads as well a sliding image gallery of all games avaliable on the website creating a dynamic and engaging experience.
